# Configuring-Static-VLANs-on-Cisco-Switches
This project focuses on configuring static Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) on Cisco switches using Packet Tracer. The primary goal is to set up two network switches, each with four computers, and establish two VLANs. These VLANs will be interconnected through a trunk port, with all eight computers sharing a common subnet. The project leverages the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard Ethernet frame and the IEEE 802.1Q standard for VLAN tagging.
